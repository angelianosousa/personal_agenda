# Personal Agenda

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to be a personal agenda where the user adds his goals with clear deadlines to meet and can follow his entire agenda from the palm of his hand or from his computer.

You add a goal and break it down into smaller goals, describe it if you want, and keep track of everything on a calendar and get notifications if you have any tasks close to completion.
